<h1>WoW Stats</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an application created for a fictional online game betting website called MMOMoney. The application first examines several player characteristics which may determine the outcome of
2v2 arena matches, creates machine learning models based on those characteristics, and rates their accuracy. After discovering the most accurate metric (race), a user may select races for two 2v2 teams and predict the winner.
